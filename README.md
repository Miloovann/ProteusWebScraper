# ProteusScraper
Automating a Task on a website

ProteusScraper is an impromptu, one-afternoon project. 

Proteus is the name of a fake organisation whose sole purpose is to scam people of their money. 
Scammers who work under Proteus reach out to people offering them fake jobs. 
These jobs involve visiting their website, [Proteus](https://www.proteus-ranks.com), to repeatedly "place orders" for 45 times, for a prize money (which is of course non-existent)



This project therefore delves deep into the inner workings of the website, investigating its structure, and afterwards automating the task of "placing order" using web scraping technologies.
